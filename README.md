*Correlation/Ratios between exchanges fees and quantity of new exchanges
*Correlation/Ratios on how cryptos are correlated with each other

Glassnode, Coinbase, API from crypto HW

**Rough breakdown of tasks (2-3 next action items)**

*Collect data
  *Price
  *Mkt Cap
  *Volume 
  *Mining Activity
  *Exchanges/Exchange Fees
  *Timeframe: Total History & shorter time period (2015?)
*Clean data
*Propose best possible correlations and construct Monte Carlo simulation
