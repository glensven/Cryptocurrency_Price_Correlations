Group 1 Team Members
1)	Glen Svenningsen

Project Description/Outline
Portfolio Analyzer of Crypto & Exchanges: Ability to pick a cryptocurrency and exchange based on historical information. Statistics would provide basis if cryptocurrency is in a bear or bull market position. Portfolio would leverage APIs and statistics to provide backbone to the project.
Research questions to answer
1)	Correlation/Ratios between mining activity and volume
2)	Correlation/Ratios between crypto transactions and exchanges
3)	Correlation/Ratios between exchanges fees and quantity of new exchanges
4)	Correlation/Ratios on how cryptos are correlated with each other
Datasets to be used:1) Glassnode 2) Coinbase 3) API from crypto HW
Rough breakdown of tasks (2-3 next action items)
1)	Scope of currencies to work with
a.	BTC, Bitcoin cash, Etherium, Litecoin, Tether, Dogecoin
2)	Determine how to structure data by reviewing APIs and analyzing which blocks of data to pull from each API (Alex to start)
a.	Collect data
i.	Price
ii.	Mkt Cap
iii.	Volume 
iv.	Mining Activity
v.	Exchanges/Exchange Fees
vi.	Timeframe: Total History & shorter time period (2015?)
b.	Clean data
3)	Propose best possible correlations and construct Monte Carlo simulation
