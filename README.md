# Project-1
**Project Title**
“Get Glen a Condo with a Crypto Picker”

**Group 1 Team Members**
Glen Svenningsen
Alex Manley
Erik Prieto

**Project Description/Outline**
Portfolio Analyzer of Crypto & Exchanges: Ability to pick a cryptocurrency and exchange based on historical information. Statistics would provide basis if cryptocurrency is in a bear or bull market position. Portfolio would leverage APIs and statistics to provide backbone to the project.

**Research questions to answer**
1. Correlation/Ratios between mining activity and volume
2. Correlation/Ratios between crypto transactions and exchanges
3. Correlation/Ratios between exchanges fees and quantity of new exchanges
4. Correlation/Ratios on how cryptos are correlated with each other

**Datasets to be used:**  
Glassnode, Coinbase, API from crypto HW

**Rough breakdown of tasks (2-3 next action items)**
1. Scope of currencies to work with
BTC, Bitcoin cash, Etherium, Litecoin, Tether, Dogecoin
2. Determine how to structure data by reviewing APIs and analyzing which blocks of data to pull from each API (Alex to start)
3. Collect data
  *Price
  *Mkt Cap
  *Volume 
  *Mining Activity
  *Exchanges/Exchange Fees
  *Timeframe: Total History & shorter time period (2015?)
4. Clean data
5. Propose best possible correlations and construct Monte Carlo simulation 

**Day 2:**
Action Items:
1.	EP pull Litecoin. 
2.	Glen pull Eth.
3.	Alex keep working with Bitcoin

Types of Plots/Correlations
1. Heatmaps by year
2. Correlations on volume and price
3. Coins mined
Generally think about how we want to visualize and put together. 

Nice to have:
1.	Livestream pull. 
2.	Time range pull. 
3.	Plot treasuries & S&P 500.
4.	More Tickers:	bitcoin cash and doge from Coinbase

Tips:
1.	Don’t take on too much. Priority is to get something that works.
2.	Jason has a subscription to glassnode

**Day 4:**
Work on Correlations and Graphs

1. Price/Volume – Alex 
2.	Addresses/Mining - Glen
3.	Supply/Transactions – Erik 

I’ll be testing Sharpe Ratio to see if it is a useful indicator overall
