**App Problem to Solve**

Consolidating and utilizing publicly available crypto information for investment gains.

Utilizing Glassnode API to retreive pricing, trading activity, and mining activity. The information is then flowed into correlations and other statistical measures, such as the Sharpe Ratio, in order to determine whether the portfolio of cryptocurrencies are a good investment.  

**Steps Taken**
1. Setting up the appropriate python environment.
2. Imported Libraries including new ones such as yfinance! 
3. Collected the data from glassnode and yfinance API.
4. Cleaned and aggregated the data from the API and Y Finance! 
5. Conducted ana analysis utilizing correlations, ratios, and visualizations.
6. Condensed plots to a presentation format. 
7. Merged all changes into a primary branch.

**Coding and Analysis**:
App will be shown during presentation. All coding and visualizations are essentially finished. 

**Application upgrades to consider**: 
Further automation and machine learning, usage of private information, and broader analysis of top 20 currencies.
